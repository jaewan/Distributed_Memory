# Distributed_Memory
In an age where in-memory distributed computing is widespread, optimizing memory usage have the potential to save computational resources. 

## Getting Started
Fork and then clone the repo to the local machine by running the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/{GITHUB_USERNAME}/Distributed_Memory.git
```

## Benchmarks and Preliminary Tests
- [ ] Ray object store capacity and performance changes.
- [ ] Running HiBench on Spark: analysis of disk spillage and throughput.
- [ ] Peak memory usage prediction viabilities on Ray.

** For more details, read `README` in the benchmarks folder.
